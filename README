= RightJS Home

This is the RightJS framework home page project.

Nothing big, just a news feed, some templates work and automatic api-documentation building.


See the app/views/pages directory for the static pages, tutorials, etc.


All the api-documentation is stored and maintained in the rightjs-core project repository



== NOTE

Don't forget to run on update

  <tt>rake rightjs:update</tt>
  
It will rebuild the database of the API
