# RightJS Home

This is the RightJS framework home page project.

Nothing big, just a news feed, some templates work and automatic api-documentation building.


See the `docs/` directory for the static pages, tutorials, etc.


All the api-documentation is stored and maintained in the rightjs-core project repository

    http://github.com/rightjs/rightjs-core/tree/master/doc/


## NOTE

Don't forget to run the following task on update

    rake rightjs:update
  
It will rebuild the database of the API (will take couple of minutes)
