# RubyOnRails Support

This module provides a conventional interface for most common ajax operations in RubyOnRails projects.
Plus it has underscored and ruby-like aliases for the core RightJS methods.

The plugin by itself is situated [over here](http://github.com/MadRabbit/right-rails).
It is available as a ruby-on-rails plugin and as a ruby-gem. There are also some documentation at the project's wiki.

## Download

Generally this plugin is meant to be used with ruby-on-rails projects, but if you want to use
it with different framework, you can download the plugin right here.
