# Project Philosophy

Although it looks small simple and not always serious, RightJS actually has
a pretty solid idea behind and if you would like to have it described in one sentence
that would be "causal but well organized"


## Causal, but Well Organized

RightJS does not have any intention to enlight you with some radically new approach
in JavaScript development, but rather does something quite opposite.

The main target of RightJS is to create a simple, fast and reliable tool for a true
agile development. RightJS simplifies many routine operations making JavaScript
development an easy and natural thing. It looks simple, it works simple, but that
is the kind of simplicity that lets you concentrate on serious things instead of
fighting for survival.


## Designed, not Evolved

Whatever your previous experience is jQuery, Prototype, Mootools, Ruby, Python or PHP.
When you look through RightJS API, you immediately spot familiar things. But don't get
fooled, it was designed this way intentionally, to make it easy to work with for people
with different backgrounds.

And it's not just designed to be familiar, it is designed to make JavaScript development
a most natural thing specifically for the server-side developers who work with dynamic
languages like Ruby or Python. We have extensive object-oriented programming features,
flexible dynamic language attitude, native units extensions, etc.


## Don't Learn, Have Fun!

You might noticed that there is not much of the documentation for RightJS. The reason
is that we simplified and systematically organized all the things the way there is
almost nothing to learn. Because we don't want you to learn, we want you to have fun.

There are just a few key features in RightJS you need to know to start working with it.
Well, you even don't need to know them either, because when you see things like that

    $(element).update('with text').highlight();
    
    $(element).onClick('addClass', 'clicked');
    
    $$('li').each('onClick', 'toggleClass', 'marked');

You don't need to be a genius or read any documentation to figure out what's going on.
Those things snap immediately even for people who is just starting their way to
JavaScript development.

## And It's Highly Hackable!

RightJS might look like a simple and cute thing, but it is very hackable too. We've
put lots of thoughts, tries, tests and years of experience in the internal structures 
development in order to bring in the JavaScript development the joy of dynamic
languages programming.

We specifically choose object-oriented structures and functionality injection approach,
providing a clean and reliable working skeleton, which can be easily bended, patched
and overridden when your task requires any sort of customization.

If you can hack it on the server-side, you don't need to change your habits and can
have the same exact fun with RightJS on the front-side.
